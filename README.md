# rust_browser_engine

This is my implementation of a toy browser engine.

It should be able to parse HTML and CSS and render the result.

Note that this project was highly inspired by this series of articles:
[Let's build a browser engine!](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html), by Matt Brubeck.
